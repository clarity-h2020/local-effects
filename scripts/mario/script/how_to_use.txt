#1
load_all.sh
This script checks database to see which heat wave and pluvial flood data is already calculated for the citties in the system, then takes those one which are not calculated and
This script delete logs and data for a city.
calls for the rest of the scripts to do the calculation as follows:

#2
load_city.sh
This script is able to load into the database all data for a specific city given as paramater.
It records time spent to load a city
It deletes logs and data for a specific city

#3
heat_waves_main.sh
For a given city it gathers needed data from file system(UA,ESM,STL), preparing it for further processing and calls to layers9_12 then call land use scripts(12).
Generates each grid cell register for land use wich its corresponding land use percentages of each cell and hillshade building and built_density
It also records city size(in grid cells)
Do some cleaning after city loads (layer9-12 
Deletes temporary layer tables --> habria que poner que cada script de capa borre sus tablas!
It records heat wave data generation time for a city

#3.1
layers9_12.sh
For a given city and by using prepared data for the city in the file system, it is able to generate and store it in database data corresponding to layers 9,10,11 and 12 
all toghether to support each future single layer processing (to generate specific parameters).

#3.2 LAYERS (Land use scripts)
(water.sh,roads.sh,railways.sh,trees.sh,vegetation.sh,agricultural_areas.sh,built_open_spaces.sh,(BUILT_UP IS NO LONGER USED),sports.sh,dense_urban_fabric.sh,medium_urban_fabric.sh,low_urban_fabric.sh,public_military_industrial.sh)
Each one of those can generate its corresponding land use data for a given city and store it in database corresponding final table

#4
pluvial_flood_main.sh
For a given city it gathers needed data from database(streams,basins) as well as DEM(form file system) and process them to generate final data for streams and basins related to the given city
That means generate basin altitudes (minimum), cell (DEM) mean altitudes and stream count per cell
It also generates run_off_coefficient heighted average for a cell
It records pluvial flood data generation time for a city


------

delete_city.sh
This script is able to delete from database all auxuliary tables, and all goemetries from final tables, for every layer as well as local auxiliary files in data folder for a given city name.
